# Program Database (PDB) tool

This is a simple tool for reading Program Database files. It uses the
[`ms-pdb`](https://crates.io/crates/ms-pdb) crate to read and write PDB.

This tool is published as a separate crate in order to minimize the dependencies of the `ms-pdb`
crate.

## Installation

```batch
cargo install pdbtool
```

## Examples

```
pdbtool dump hello_world.pdb streams
```

produces:

```text
Stream #     0 : (size          0) OldStreamDir
Stream #     1 : (size        665) PDB
Stream #     2 : (size   15341432) TPI
Stream #     3 : (size    1668945) DBI
Stream #     4 : (size    1871280) IPI
Stream #     5 : (size          0) Named { name: "/LinkInfo" }
Stream #     6 : (size          0) Named { name: "/TMCache" }
Stream #     7 : (size     140696) Named { name: "/names" }
[...]
```

Use `pdbtool --help` for a list of commands. Use `pdbtool dump --help` for help with the `dump`
command, which has many subcommands.

## Interactive TUI Mode

The tool also provides an interactive Terminal User Interface (TUI) mode for exploring PDB files:

```batch
pdbtool --interactive hello_world.pdb
```

This launches a two-pane interface:
- **Left pane**: Tree view of the PDB structure (streams, modules, symbols, etc.)
- **Right pane**: Details panel showing information about the selected item

### TUI Navigation

- `↑/↓` - Navigate tree items
- `Enter/→` - Expand/collapse selected node
- `q` or `Esc` - Quit

The TUI displays placeholder content for each selected tree element based on PDB data:
- **Debug Info**: Shows binding key and overview
- **Symbols**: Information about the Global Symbol Stream
- **Types**: Type stream header information and index ranges
- **Modules**: Module count and details for each compilation unit
- **Individual Modules**: Module name, object file, stream info, and sizes
- **Source Files**: Source information overview
- **Names**: Names stream information
- **Streams**: Raw stream data overview

The tree structure is dynamically built from the PDB file contents, making it easy to explore the hierarchical organization of debug information.

## Help

```batch
pdbtool --help
```

```text
Usage: pdbtool [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  add-src     Adds source file contents to the PDB. The contents are embedded directly within the PDB. WinDbg and Visual Studio can both extract the source files
  copy        Copies a PDB from one file to another. All stream contents are preserved exactly, byte-for-byte. The blocks within streams are laid out sequentially
  test
  dump
  save
  find        Searches the DBI Section Contributions table
  find-name   Searches the TPI Stream for a given type
  counts      Counts the number of records and record sizes for a given set of PDBs
  hexdump     Dumps part of a file (any file, not just a PDB) as a hex dump. If you want to dump a specific stream, then use the `dump <filename> hex` command instead
  pdz-encode
  help        Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
      --quiet        Reduce logging to just warnings and errors in `mspdb` and `pdbtool` modules
      --verbose      Turn on debug output in all `mspdb` and `pdbtool` modules. Noisy!
      --timestamps   Show timestamps in log messages
      --tracy        Connect to Tracy (diagnostics tool). Requires that the `tracy` Cargo feature be enabled
      --interactive  Launch interactive TUI mode for exploring PDB files
  -h, --help         Print help
```

## Help - dump

The `dump` subcommand takes a path to a PDB file as its next argument, followed by a subcommand,
as seen in the example above.

```batch
pdbtool dump --help
```

```text
Usage: pdbtool dump [OPTIONS] <PDB> <COMMAND>

Commands:
  names
  globals
  tpi                  Dump the Type Stream (TPI)
  ipi                  Dump the Id Stream (TPI)
  dbi                  Dump DBI header
  dbi-enc              Dump DBI Edit-and-Continue Substream
  dbi-type-server-map
  gsi                  Global Symbol Index. Loads the GSI and iterates through its hash records. For each one, finds the symbol record in the GSS and displays it
  psi                  Public Symbol Index. Loads the PSI and iterates through its hash records. For each one, finds the symbol record in the GSS and displays it
  modules
  streams              Dump the Stream Directory
  lines                Dumps C13 Line Data for a given module
  sources              Dump the DBI Stream - Sources substream
  section-map
  section-contribs     Dump section contributions (quite large!)
  pdbi                 Dump the PDB Info Stream
  module-symbols       Displays the symbols for a specific module
  hex                  Dump the contents of a stream, or a subsection of it, using a hexadecimal dump format. By default, this will only show a portion of the stream; use `--len` to increase it
  help                 Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Arguments:
  <PDB>  The PDB to dump

Options:
      --lines-like-cvdump
  -h, --help               Print help
```

## Converting PDB files to Compressed PDB (PDZ/MSFZ)

> **WARNING** **WARNING** **WARNING** **WARNING** **WARNING**
>
> This tool provides an _experimental_ capability for compressing PDBs into a new PDB container
> format, called MSFZ. See the [MSFZ Container Specification](https://github.com/microsoft/pdb-rs/blob/main/msfz/src/msfz.md).
> This container specification is _experimental_ and is not guaranteed to be stable. It may change
> at any time; there is no guarantee of compatibility, stability, or reliability. It is defined
> for the purposes of experimentation.
>
> **WARNING** **WARNING** **WARNING** **WARNING** **WARNING**

MSFZ is intended to reduce development costs, by defining a compression format for PDB, which
still allows tools (such as debuggers) to read from compressed PDBs by decompressing only those
parts of the PDB that are needed. This avoids the need to decompress the entire PDB. See the
specification (linked above) for details.

To convert a PDB file to a compressed PDB:

```batch
pdbtool pdz-encode hello_world.pdb d:\compressed_pdbs\hello_world.pdb
```

This reads the `hello_world.pdb`, compresses its contents, and writes it to
`d:\compressed_pdbs\hello_world.pdb`. Recent versions of the Windows Debugger
(WinDbg) can directly read compressed PDB files. _It cannot be over-emphasized
that this support is experimental, and subject to change without notice._
